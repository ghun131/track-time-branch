## Todos

- [ ] Simplify the command line, currently it is `node <filename>`
- [ ] Simplify installation process
    - `npm istall <my package>` should make an track_time.js file at the root folder
    - I am thinking on the line of using people api-key. Of course I won't make them provide me 
    their api keys, they will probably have to input the key in the command line when they install
    for the first time. This approach is problematic because it's not guarantee security
    - In the future, write a server to authenticate users (save their token)
- [x] Publish it as an npm package
- [ ] Format the output to look better

some change to make this file longer
