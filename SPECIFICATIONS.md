When push code, remember to reset credential

- [x] Simplify the command line, currently it is `node <filename>`
- [ ] Webpack to optimize the code
- [x] Simplify installation process
    - `npm istall <my package>` should make an track_time.js file at the root folder
    - In the future, write a server to authenticate users (save their token)
